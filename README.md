Welcome to my second project in The Odin Project: The Stoic Newsletter! ðŸŽ‰

It's a landing page where people can sign up for a daily dose of Stoic wisdom. I spent a lot of time learning and playing around with Flexbox and I had a blast. This project challenged me, taught me a ton, and I can't wait to dive into the next one. ðŸš€

Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ˜Š
